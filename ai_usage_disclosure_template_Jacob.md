### Prompts Used
"these are the instructions for my assignment attached and this is what I have so far, can you explain to me what still needs to be done and give me a psuedo code layout with explanations"

"This is the assignment explain what else needs to be done"

"How does my code look now?"

### AI Output/Results
AI gave me psuedo code changes and fixes as well as a layout of what needed to still be done

Claude helped provide details on what was missing and needed to be added, and also pointed out some errors

Pointed out one issue with activation boundary detection and provided a simpler approach than what we were previously using

### How Output was Verified/Edited
I reviewed and implemented my own code using the psuedo code template for guidance and ideas, then tested my code to insure it worked

### Multiple Iterations (if applicable)
First asked for psuedo code and a layout to get started, after implementing code asked what else needed to be done and how my current code was looking, finally asked for review of finished code

### Learning & Reflection
I have a better understanding of navigating code and organizing my thoughts when starting, I also got an insight on debugging and fixing issues with my code
